        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Emmanuel Ekanem, an aspiring IT Cloud Specialist with a strong foundation in IT infrastructure, cloud systems, and software development. While pursuing my Master’s in Information Technology at the Washington University of Science and Technology, I excelled academically, graduating with a 4.0 GPA and earning a spot on the Presidential List.

          My passion lies in leveraging modern technologies like cloud computing and DevOps tools to build scalable, secure, and efficient solutions. Through hands-on projects, I’ve gained expertise in Linux system administration, programming, CI/CD automation, and cloud platform management using AWS and Azure.
          
          I thrive on solving complex problems, collaborating with teams, and staying ahead of industry trends through continuous learning. Beyond my technical pursuits, I enjoy strategy games like chess, which reflect my approach to technology—careful planning, adaptability, and long-term thinking.
          
          Looking ahead, I aspire to work on innovative projects in cloud computing and cybersecurity, contributing to impactful and sustainable solutions that drive progress in the tech industry.</p>

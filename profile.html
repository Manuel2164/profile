        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Emmanuel Ekanem, a dedicated graduate with a Master’s degree in Information Technology from the Washington University of Science and Technology, where I achieved a 4.0 GPA and was recognized on the Presidential List. My academic background combines strong foundations in cloud computing, DevOps, and software systems, with practical experience in AWS, Azure, Linux system administration, and CI/CD automation.

Beyond cloud and infrastructure, I have a strong interest in intelligent systems, automation, and human-technology interaction. As an undergraduate, I completed several robotics-related projects, including a robotic arm, an autonomous firefighting robot, and a smart traffic light system. These experiences deepened my interest in real-time systems, embedded programming, and applied machine learning.

I am broadly interested in research areas across distributed systems, intelligent automation, cybersecurity, human-computer interaction, and applied AI. I aim to explore how scalable, intelligent technologies can be designed to solve real-world problems and enhance system adaptability, security, and performance. I am excited to contribute to impactful, interdisciplinary research through a Computer Science PhD program.</p>
